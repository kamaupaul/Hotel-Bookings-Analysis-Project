## Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains comprehensive details about hotel bookings. For a deeper dive into the data, refer to [Data/README.md](Data/README.md).

## Time Series Analysis

I've employed time series analysis techniques, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, to unveil booking trends over time. Here's a sneak peek:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

result = adfuller(df['bookings'])
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('p-value:', result[1])
```

## Clustering

I've employed advanced clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior. This allows for targeted marketing strategies. For detailed customer segments, check out [Clustering/README.md](Clustering/README.md).

## Results

My analysis has uncovered key findings, such as seasonal booking trends and distinct customer segments. These insights empower businesses to make data-driven decisions and enhance customer experiences.
